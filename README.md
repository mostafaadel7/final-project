#1README for AWS Final Project
Project Title: AWS Infrastructure Deployment and Web Application Hosting
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a scalable, secure, and highly available web application using AWS services. The infrastructure is defined and managed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.

Features
Network Infrastructure Setup with IaC:

Use of AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to define and manage the network infrastructure.
Segmentation using Subnets and security with Security Groups and Network ACLs.
NAT Gateway deployment to provide internet access for private instances without public exposure.
Web Application Hosting on EC2 or Microservices:

Deployment using Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, or Amazon EKS.
Auto Scaling for high availability and scalability.
Elastic Load Balancer for traffic distribution across multiple Availability Zones.
Static Content Storage and Delivery:

Static content hosted on Amazon S3 with versioning enabled for backup and recovery.
Use of AWS CloudFront as a CDN to enhance global latency and user experience.
Security, Scalability, and High Availability:

IAM roles and policies for secure access management.
Multi-AZ deployments and Auto Scaling to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
Disaster recovery strategies implemented.
HTTP to HTTPS Redirection:

Application Load Balancer configured to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
SSL/TLS certificates for encrypted communication.
S3 Integration with EC2:

Mounting S3 buckets on EC2 instances using s3fs or AWS CLI for seamless storage integration.
Prerequisites
AWS Account
Access to AWS CloudFormation/Terraform
SSL/TLS certificate (self-signed or AWS Certificate Manager)
