# AWS Highly Available Web Application with Infrastructure as Code

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy a highly available AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CloudFormation (YAML).

The goal was to automate infrastructure provisioning, reduce manual setup time, and implement a secure, scalable architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components
- AWS CloudFormation (YAML Templates)
- Custom VPC with Public & Private Subnets
- Route Tables & NAT Gateway
- EC2 Instances
- Application Load Balancer
- Amazon S3 Storage with Versioning
- Multi-AZ High Availability
